Previous: [[2. Infrastructure of Search Algorithms]]

We evaluate search strategies based on four key criteria:

# 1. Completeness
If the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one?

# 2. Optimality
Does the strategy find the optimal solution (the one with the lowest path cost)?

# 3. Time Complexity
How long does it take to find a solution? This is often measured by the number of nodes generated.

# 4. Space Complexity
How much memory is needed to perform the search? Measured by the maximum number of nodes stored in memory.
