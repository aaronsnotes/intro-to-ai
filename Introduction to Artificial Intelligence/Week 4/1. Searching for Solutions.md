# Search trees vs. state space
- **Goal:** a solution is an **action sequence** that leads from the initial state to a goal state.
- **Search tree:** we model the search by superimposing a search tree over the state space.
	- The **root** is the initial state.
	- **Branches** correspond to actions.
	- **Nodes** correspond to states in the state space.
- **Expansion:** we "expand" the current state by applying each legal action to generate a new set of child nodes.

# Tree search vs. graph search
- **Tree search:** follows one option and puts others aside. It explores paths but does not inherently track visited states.
- **Graph search:** includes an **explored set** (or closed list) to keep track of states that have already been visited. This prevents processing the same state multiple times.

# Redundant paths
- **Redundant paths:** these exist whenever there is more than one way to get from one state to another.
- **Loopy paths:** a special case of redundant paths where a sequence of actions leads back to a state that appeared in the path.
	- Infinite loops can occur in Tree Search if loopy paths are not handled.
