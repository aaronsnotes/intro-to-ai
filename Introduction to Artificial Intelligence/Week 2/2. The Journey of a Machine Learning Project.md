Previous: [[1. What is Learning?]]

A typical project follows these 8 steps:
1. **Defining the problem:** formulating the task (T, P, E) and selecting a model type (e.g., classification).
2. **Collecting data:** acquiring the raw data, considering ethics.
3. **Preparing data:** cleaning the data, transforming it into features (e.g., for spam: email length, % of digits), and splitting it.
4. **Choosing a model:** selecting the algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, k-NN).
5. **Training:** the model *learns* the patterns from the **training set**.
6. **Evaluation:** the model's performance is measured against the **test (evaluation) set**, which it has *never seen* before.
7. **Tuning:** adjusting **hyperparameters** (like the 'k' in k-NN) using a **validation set** to get the best performance.
8. **Prediction:** using the final, trained model to make predictions on new, live data.
