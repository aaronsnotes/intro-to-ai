# Learning types
- **Supervised:** learning from data that has a "ground truth" or correct label (e.g., spam/not spam).
- **Unsupervised:** learning from data with no labels. The goal is to find inherent structures, like grouping data into clusters.
- **Reinforcement:** learning by trial and error based on **rewards** or **penalties** from an environment (e.g., a robot learning to navigate a maze).

# Error vs. loss
- **Error:** the discrepancy between the model's prediction and the actual ground truth.
- **Loss function:** a mathematical, differentiable expression of the error (e.g., **L2 Loss / Squared Error**). The model uses this as feedback; by minimising the loss, it "learns".

# Over-fitting vs. under-fitting
- **Under-fitting:** the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data (high error on training data).
- **Over-fitting:** the model is too complex and learns the *noise* in the training data. It performs well on data it has seen, but fails to **generalise** to new data (low error on training data, high error on testing).
- **Regularisation:** a set of techniques used to prevent over-fitting by penalising complex models.
