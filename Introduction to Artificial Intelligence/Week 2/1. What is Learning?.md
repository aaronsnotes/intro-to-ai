# Definitions
- **Herbert Simon:** "Learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience."
- **Tom Mitchell:** "Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that improve their performance `<P>` at some task `<T>` with some experience `<E>`."

# Example: spam detection
This is a classic **classification** problem:
- **Task `<T>`:** identify if an email is spam.
- **Performance `<P>`:** the percentage (%) of emails correctly classified.
- **Experience `<E>`:** a database of emails already flagged by users as "spam" or "not spam".

# Why use learning?
Learning is preferred when:
- Humans can't easily explain their expertise (e.g., recognising a face).
- No human expertise exists for the task (e.g., navigating a new planet).
- Human expertise is limited, biased, or inconsistent.
- The problem is too huge for humans to analyse (e.g., global financial markets).
