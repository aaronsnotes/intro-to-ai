Using the neural network from the lab tutorial:
- **Problem type:** binary classification (Diabetes: Yes/No).
- **Output layer:**
	- **Activation:** Sigmoid ($\sigma$) is used to output a probability between 0 and 1.
	- **Loss function:** binary cross-entropy is optimised to minimise the difference between the predicted probability and the true label (0 or 1).
- **Adapting for Blood Pressure (regression):**
	- **Output activation:** change to Linear, ReLU, or Tanh (to output a continuous value).
	- **Loss function:** change to Mean Squared Error (MSE).
