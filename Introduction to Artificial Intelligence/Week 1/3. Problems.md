# Key questions for AI problems
When tackling any AI application, you should ask:
1. What is the AI problem I want to solve?
2. Why is it important to solve?
3. How can I solve it?
4. How can I solve it in a *better* way (e.g., more robustly or efficiently)?

# Well-defined problems
A problem needs to be formally defined with five components:
1. **The initial state:** where the agent starts.
2. **Possible actions:** a description of available actions. `ACTIONS(s)` returns the set of actions available in state `s`.
3. **Transition model:** a description of what each action does. `RESULT(s, a)` returns the state that results from doing action `a` in state `s`.
4. **The goal test:** determines if a given state is a goal state.
5. **A path cost function:** assigns a numeric cost to each path, which reflects the agent's performance measure.

## Example: airline travel
- **States:** a location (e.g., airport), the current time, and historical info (e.g., previous flights).
- **Initial state:** specified by the user's query.
- **Actions:** take any flight from the current location.
- **Transition model:** the resulting state is the flight's destination and arrival time.
- **Goal test:** is the current location the final destination?
- **Path cost:** a function of monetary cost, waiting time, flight time, customs, seat quality, etc.
