# What is AI?
AI is broadly defined by its goals. The definitions can be organised into four categories:
1. **Thinking humanly:** creating "machines with minds". This involves cognitive modelling, or automating activities we associate with human thinking, like decision making, problem solving, and learning.
2. **Thinking rationally:** using computational models to study mental faculties. This is the "laws of thought" approach, focusing on the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act.
3. **Acting humanly:** creating machines that perform functions requiring intelligence when done by people. The classic example is the **Turing Test**.
4. **Acting rationally:** designing "intelligent agents". This focuses on "intelligent behaviour in artefacts".

A central modern idea is the **ability to learn from data and apply it to a context.** This includes spam filtering, medical image processing, and ChatGPT.

# The Turing Test
- **Concept:** a human interrogator interacts with both a human and a machine via a text-based interface.
- **Goal:** the interrogator must determine which is the machine.
- **Pass condition:** if the machine can "fool" the interrogator, it is considered intelligent.
- **Requirements:** to pass, the machine needs to:
	- "Understand" the questions,
	- have or acquire knowledge to answer,
	- formulate answers in natural human language.

# Inspiration from nature
- Humans have long taken inspiration from nature: birds for flight, burdock burrs for Velcro, and kingfishers for bullet trains.
- For AI, a key inspiration is the **human brain**.
- **Biological neuron:** a cell in the cerebral cortex with:
	- **Dendrites:** inputs that receive electrical impulses.
	- **Cell body:** contains the nucleus.
	- **Axon:** the output, which connects to other cells via synapses.
- A neuron "fires" its own signal when it receives sufficient input signals.
- **Artificial neuron:** this biological model inspired the artificial neuron.
	- McCulloch & Pitts (1943) proposed a simple neuron with binary inputs and one binary output.
	- It activates its output if a given number of inputs are active.
	- They showed that a network of these neurons can compute any logical proposition.
