# What is an agent?
- **Definition:** an agent is "anything that can be viewed as perceiving its **environment** through **sensors** and acting upon that environment through **actuators**".
- **Percept sequence:** the complete history of everything the agent has perceived.

# Examples of agents
- **Human agent:**
	- *Sensors:* eyes, ears, other organs.
	- *Actuators:* hands, legs, vocal tract.
- **Robotic agent:**
	- *Sensors:* cameras, infrared range finders.
	- *Actuators:* motors.
- **Software agent:**
	- *Sensors:* keystrokes, file contents, network packets.
	- *Actuators:* displaying on screen, writing files, sending network packets.

# Intelligent/rational agents
- **Definition:** a rational agent is one that "does the right thing".
- **Rationality:** for each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action expected to **maximise its performance measure**, given the evidence from percepts and any built-in knowledge.
- An agent that learns is one that **improves its performance** after making observations about the world.

# Types of intelligent agents
There are several types of agents, including:
- Simple reflex agents
- Model-based reflex agents
- Goal-based agents (a "problem-solving agent" is a type of goal-based agent)
- Utility-based agents
- Learning agents
